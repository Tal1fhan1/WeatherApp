# Overview

I wanted to tackle this programming language because I have heard a lot about how common and versatile it is in the programming space. I am specifically interesting in learning it for the use of creating mobile applications. I have also seen in many job opening descriptions that they, more often than not, require who is experienced with using Java. I think this module acts as the first stepping stone towards me being able to meet those requirements one day.

The purpose of this software program is to provide users a way for them to see the most relevent weather information about any place simply by searching the name of the city. It is meant to be very straight forward and easy to use. It makes use of API calls and custom built classes to get the information from openweatherapp.org, display it to the user based on what they search and write that info down in another file for future reference.
