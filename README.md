# Overview

The vast majority of companies that are in operation nowadays have their own mobile apps.
As such, programmers who are able to create mobile apps are in high demand. 
This is why I chose to create a mobile app for this module. It will me gain a skill
that will make me more favorable in the eyes of companies that I want to work for.

# Future Work

- I want to find a way to make the weather app start faster. At the moment it takes an extra two seconds to start up, so shaving that time down would make it feel quicker.
